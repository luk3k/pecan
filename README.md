A visual source code annotation framework for VScode extension. This framework helps develop extensions that require visual elements like decorations and codeLenses.

## Features
* Java & Python parsers included based on antlr
* Intuitive way to declare decorations and codeLenses
* Manages different editors and their state in background

## Background
This framework was developed as part of a bachelor thesis.
After a short analysis of existing VSCode extension, we derived which visual elements are used the most and used these findings to develop the framework. We also developed two small extension as case studies to test the performance of the framework. More details can be found in our paper.

## Release Notes & Info
The final framework should be fully functional, but there might be some unforeseen bugs. Also, this framework will not be actively maintained.
